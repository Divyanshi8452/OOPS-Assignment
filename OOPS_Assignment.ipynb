        "# Theory Question\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming\n",
        "--> It is a way of writing code that is based on \"objects\", like how we think about things in real life.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "--> - A blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "- Defines properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects can use.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "--> A real thing made from the class. (Like an actual cake made from the recipe).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "--> Encapsulation (Hiding the data)\n",
        "It's like putting things inside a box so others can't mess with them directly.\n",
        "*  It bundles data (variables) and methods (functions) into one unit (a class).\n",
        "*  It also protects the data by restricting direct access to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction ( Hiding the complexity)\n",
        "It's like using something without knowing how it works inside.\n",
        "*  It hides the internal details and shows only the essential parts.\n",
        "*  Usually done through abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "--> Dunder methods are special methods in Python that start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-->Inheritance means that one class can inherit or reuse the features of another class (called a parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "--> In OOP, it lets different classes use the same method name, but each class can have its own version of how that method works.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "--> Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of how something works, and only showing what is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is used to protect data inside a class, so it can't be changed directly from outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "--> A constructor in Python is a special method that runs automatically when you create an object from a class.\n",
        "It's used to set up the object with some starting values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        "-->  \n",
        "####class method\n",
        " A class method is a method that belongs to the class itself, not to any one object.\n",
        "It can access and modify class state.\n",
        "####static method\n",
        "A static method doesn't access instance (self) or class (cls) variables.\n",
        "It's like a regular function but lives inside the class for organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "--> Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to call the same method name but with different arguments, and the program decides which one to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "--> Method overriding happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that already exists in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The child class's method replaces the parent class's method when called on an object of the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This lets the child class customize or change the behavior of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-->\n",
        "* It lets you define a method that you can access like a regular variable.\n",
        "* This helps to control how you get or set a value without changing how you access it.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "--> 1 Flexibility\n",
        "2 Code Reusability\n",
        "3 Easier Maintenance\n",
        "4 Supports Interface and Design Patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "--> An abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated on its own, it's meant to be a base class for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines a common interface (methods) that child classes must implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can have some methods implemented, and some abstract methods that have no implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "--> 1 Modularity\n",
        "2 Reusability\n",
        "3 Scalability\n",
        "4 Data Security (Encapsulation)\n",
        "5 Flexibility (Polymorphism)\n",
        "6 Maintainability\n",
        "7 Real-world Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-->\n",
        "Class Variable:\n",
        "- Shared by all instances: A variable that belongs to the class itself.\n",
        "- Same value for all objects: Changes affect all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "- Unique to each instance: A variable that belongs to a specific object.\n",
        "- Different values for each object: Changes affect only one instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "--> Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class at the same time.\n",
        "* The child class gets features (methods and variables) from all its parent classes.\n",
        "* This helps combine behaviors from different classes into one.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__' and '__repr__\" methods in Python.\n",
        "--> 1. __repr__ (Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Purpose: Provide an official, unambiguous string representation of the object.\n",
        "* Meant for: Developers.\n",
        "* Should ideally return a string that, if passed to eval(), recreates the object (if possible).\n",
        "* Called by: repr() function and by default in the interactive interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __str__ (String)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Purpose: Provide a friendly, readable string representation of the object.\n",
        "* Meant for: End users.\n",
        "* Called by: str() function and when you use print() on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "--> The super() function in Python is used to call a method from the parent (super) class.\n",
        "It's mostly used inside child classes to reuse code from their parent classes — especially in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "--> The __del__ method is a special method in Python called a destructor.\n",
        "It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "--> @staticmethod:\n",
        "- No access to class or instance: A method that belongs to a class, but doesn't access its attributes.\n",
        "- Useful for utility functions: Methods that don't depend on the class or instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "- Access to class: A method that belongs to a class and has access to its attributes.\n",
        "- Useful for alternative constructors: Methods that create instances or modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "--> Polymorphism:\n",
        "- Multiple forms: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "- Method overriding: Subclasses can provide their own implementation of a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-->Method Chaining:\n",
        "- Returning self: A method returns the instance itself, allowing multiple method calls to be chained together.\n",
        "- Improving readability: Simplifies code and reduces the need for temporary variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "-->_call_ Method in Python\n",
        "- Making instances callable: Allows an instance of a class to be treated as a function.\n",
        "- Customizable behavior: Defines what happens when an instance is called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
